# WorkersProxy

## Introduction
WorkersProxy is a lightweight Javascript application that retrieves resource as a client from other servers.

Deploying on [Cloudflare Workers](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-workers/), which is an influential platform for building serverless applications, users could build customized reverse proxy without purchasing computing engines and configuring web servers such as Nginx.

Moreover, crucial performance, such as latency and availability, will be optimized, since your application will be distributed through Cloudflare's global network of data centers in more than 90 countries.
